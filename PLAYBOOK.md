# The Problem

Many local businesses in Ghana have no strong online presence. Thousands of customers search daily for services, but businesses often rely only on WhatsApp, phone calls, or Instagram pages.

This causes:
- Lost bookings
- Lower trust
- Reduced visibility

Businesses with websites capture more customers simply by being easier to find.

---

# The Solution

We create repeatable template-based websites that:
- Make businesses visible online
- Enable WhatsApp contact and enquiries
- Improve trust instantly

Instead of custom design every time, we build category templates that can be reused quickly.
